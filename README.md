# handle_msgs

This repository contains a set of ROS message developed and used during the [Handle Project](http://handle-project.eu)

They were designed to carry information between nodes dealing with in-hand manipulation and 
augmented the object manipulation messages (http://wiki.ros.org/object_manipulation_msgs) in ROS Electric.

The messages will be progressively upgraded to be compatible with recent versions of ROS.
